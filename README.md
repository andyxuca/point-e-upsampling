Our objective for the extension was to enhance the Point-E library by implementing recursive upsampling of point clouds. The motivation behind this was to generate higher-resolution point clouds with increased detail and density, improving the visual quality of 3D models produced by the library. The original upsampler implementation is limited to the generation of 3072 more points. We attempt to increase the number of generated points by recursively subsampling results and upsampling, and merging all points to create the final point clouds.
